f "Hey dude! Where were you?"

f "Are you okay?"

f "Do I need to be worried?"

f "Oh, man god I'm sorry."

f "I'm kind of high right now..."

"You can hear the sound of rustling in the background through the phone."

u "Dude, you're always high."

"It's the sound of a voice that's familiar, but you can't exactly make out who it is."

f "Shut up, you're high too!"

"You feel as if you could almost catch the high through the phone itself."

"More rustling noises makes its way through the phone. It sounds as if the phone is being passed to someone else."

u "Hey, you should come through!"

u "I didn't see you today, but me and Flo are hanging out at my house."

"You think for a second. The voice sounds familiar." 

pov "Carla? Is Flo over at your place?"

c "Oh, Flo didn't tell you? Yeah, we're at my place right now."

c "Nobody saw you today when we went out earlier. Did you oversleep or something?"

"You laughed nervously." 

"Feeling kind of guilty, you decided to see if you could use this chance to hang out."

pov "Yep. Completely slept through everything."

pov "But, I can come over. You don't mind if I come through?"

c "Do it!"

f "Yeah, do it!"

"Flo's voice seemed as if it were far off somewhere, and muffled."

c "Oh my god, he's coming over. Should I drive?"

pov "?"

"It sounded as if Carla turned her head away from the phone." 

"If she was attempting to make it so you couldn't hear her, it wasn't working."

f "I can drive."

c "Okay, no. You're not going to drive."

f "What do you mean I can't drive?"

"You could hear the two arguing over the phone."

"As Carla seemed to get more upset, Flo's laughter only seemed to grow."

"Just as things seemed as if they were going to reach a boiling point, you decided to interject."

pov "It's okay, I can drive."

c "..."

f "..."

c "Oh shit, is the phone still on?"

f "Yeah it is!"

"You could hear Flo laughing powerfully in the background."

c "Hey. [pov], I can drive you. It's okay."

c "Just wait right there!"

pov "Alright, alright. I'll stay here."

"Something about the entire ordeal makes you laugh."

"As the laughter subsides, you're overcome with something... overwhelming."

"You have a very bad feeling about this."

"But, the prospect of hanging with your friends excite you."

pov "Well, I guess I should go get ready."
