# Project Farsquad
A visual novel joke game for my discord chat. 
See the active project board here: https://trello.com/b/cz438C6l/project-f (You can read the dialogue scripts here, along with art and any other assets made for the game here!) 

Please note that I test the game using the Renpy SDK which you can find here: https://www.renpy.org/latest.html 

There are no executable files in this repository, so if you wish to test the game you'll need to set up the SDK before playing anything.

Special thanks to my friend Dessa for all character sprites!
